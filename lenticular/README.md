# Digital Reconstruction of Lenticular Colours

☛ **This is a work in progress.** ☚

No alpha version has been released so far.

### Long-term goals of the project

- **CLI:** A command-line programme with a library that can be used e.g. from FFmpeg (`ffmpeg` and `ffplay`) or `mpv` as well.
- **GUI:** A stand-alone programme, directly inspired by [AEO-Light](https://usc-imi.github.io/aeo-light/), that allows to generate the colours of digitised lenticular movie films, like _Kodacolor_ and _Agfacolor_.

### Mid-term goal

- Could this be a project for the next AMIA Hackday?

### Short-term goal

- Any idea for a better name than `doLCE`?
- Use the standard x and y coordinates order, instead of `Monolith 2`'s inverted one.
