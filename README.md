# Digital Restoration of Lenticular Colours from Greyscale Images

This piece of software restores the colours from digitisations of lenticular movie films (like Kodacolor or Agfacolor), made without applying the RGB filter on the lens, i.e. by using the greyscale images.

This repository contains:

- the original [doLCE](doLCE/README) source code by Joakim Reuteler (2012)
- a [work-in-progress](lenticular/README.md) source code (2018)
